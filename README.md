Our MVP:
Target audience: Casual Players (all demos - anyone 12+)
Problem addressed: FUN FUN FUN - Casual Players who would want a break in the day.
Primary goal of the product:
To create an interactive, easy to use, entertaining trivia game that works across all devices.
User Stories:
as a user, I want to play a simple game to pass the time
as a user, I want to be able to track my score so I can try and beat it

The objective is to guess the correct answer for the trivia question while being taunted mercilessly by an ever changing character of Animated Gifs that are not super supportive.
A player is presented with random questions with multiple choice answers. The player will also be able to check final score at the end of the trivial game, and play again to try and beat their score. Their previous game score will be displayed at the finish.

Programs Used:
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
Javascript and jQuery
Giphy API
OpenTrivia API
Hover.css Library
